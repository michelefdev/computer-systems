# Exercise 2.19 — T2U_4 Function

Using the table you filled in when solving Problem 2.17, fill in the following table describing the function T2U_4 (Two's-Complement to Unsigned conversion for 4-bit values):

## T2U_4 Function Table

| x | T2U_4(x) |
|---|----------|
| −8 | |
| −3 | |
| −2 | |
| −1 | |
| 0 | |
| 5 | |

## Notes

- T2U_4 converts a two's-complement 4-bit value to its unsigned equivalent
- Recall from Problem 2.17 that you determined B2T_4 values for various hex digits
- Use the relationship between two's-complement and unsigned representations
