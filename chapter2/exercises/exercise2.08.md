# Exercise 2.8 — Boolean Operations on Bit Vectors

This exercise fills the table of results when evaluating Boolean operations per bit on two bit vectors `x` and `y`. Operations are applied independently to each bit position.

## Truth table

| Operation | Result |
|-----------|----------|
| a         | 01101001 |
| b         | 01010101 |
| ~a        | 10010110 |
| ~b        | 10101010 |
| a & b     | 01000001 |
| a | b     | 01111101 |
| a ^ b     | 00111100 |
